# Introduction

Welcome to the Senior Engineer's Solidity book.

Ethereum development practices have rapidly shifted over the years. The published
educational content tends to lag behind the current industry best practices. Historically,
the best developers have not been able to allocate time on writing about _how_ they became
so good.

With this book, we hope to provide an up to date list of techniques that must be
part of your development toolkit.

Due to the rapid evolution of the space, we expect this to be a living document.

If you already think you can navigate your way around Solidity and Hardhat, you 
can jump on to the next chapter. If not, read below.
