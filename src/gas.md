# Gas Optimization

* why is this important
* intuition around what assembly is generated in store/load ops
* learning to optimize for low hanging fruit first
* tradeoff readability for performance (asm / inline code instead of fn calls)
    * don't do useless gas optimizations
* tradeoff UX for performance (e.g. off-chain indexers for on-chain minimalism)
* immutables
* uniswap snapshot testing pattern / hardhat gas table
