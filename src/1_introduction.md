# Introduction

Welcome to the Rust Ethereum book, where we'll go through examples of how to
interact with Ethereum using [ethers-rs](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/).

We assume familiarity with Ethereum's mechanics such as:
* Deploying a contract & interacting with it
* Sending funds across accounts
* Signing messages and recovering their sender
