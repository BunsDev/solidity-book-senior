# Introduction

Welcome to the Senior Engineer's Solidity book.

This book is for junior Solidity engineers looking to improve their skillset and
deepen their knowledge of Ethereum and Solidity.

## Prerequisites

Throughout the post we'll assume familiarity with Ethereum's basic 
mechanics such as:
* Solidity syntax
* Compiling, deploying and testing a smart contract using a development framework
(e.g. Hardhat, Truffle, DappTools)
* Familiarity with "old" Ethereum security pitfalls (e.g. re-entrancy, overflows/underflows)
* Writing unit tests
* Using hardhat

For the benefit of completeness and as a reference, we provide a summary of
introductory content around these terms & how to install the necessary components
of the toolchain.

## What to read if you're not familiar with the above

1. Learn basic Solidity via [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course/)
1. Keep a [Solidity cheatsheet handy](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/cheatsheet.html) or [Learn Solidity in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/solidity/)
1. Read [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/)
1. Skim through [Open Zeppelin's](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/) smart contracts and tests
1. Read [Smart Contract Security Best Practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/)
