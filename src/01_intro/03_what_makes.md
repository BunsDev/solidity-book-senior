# What makes a good Solidity developer?

A junior Ethereum developer typically is familiar with Solidity as a language. 

Maybe they don't know how to use inline assembly, or create2, or advanced proxy contract patterns, 
but they can write Solidity and test it in the framework of choice (typically Hardhat).

However, what separates a Senior Solidity developer is their focus on the following key areas:
1. Testing
1. Abstractions & Data Structures
1. Security
1. Gas Optimization
1. Documentation
1. Git Hygiene & Discipline

Before we dive deep into these, let's understand what each means.

## Testing

It is very important to write tests for your code which ensure that both the happy
cases and the unhappy cases are met. If your code contains no tests, then that's a problem.
If your code contains tests without checking the "unhappy paths", then that's also a problem.
